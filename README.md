# Smart Traffic Control System
In this project, image processing techniques are used to control traffic congestions by dynamically allocating release time for the vechicles depinding upon the density of the vechicles on the roads.
The proposed work uses Sobel edge detection filter and density calculation algorithms.
The project is based on the Caravel template provided by efabless.

## Specifications
- 2*8 bit inputs for RGB images
- Supports 32*32 bytes image resolution
- Kernel size of 3*3 bytes
- Uses SKYWATER130 PDK
- Generates 2bit output indicating which of the lights must turn on after the processing
